# 3D_Concrete_Printer
My graduation project was a 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) machine capable of fabricating concrete structures in three dimensions, similar to the way conventional 3D printers work with plastic. The system was designed to automate layer-by-layer deposition of concrete material to create complex geometries efficiently and accurately.
